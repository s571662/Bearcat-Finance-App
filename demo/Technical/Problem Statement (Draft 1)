## Problem Statement (Draft 1)
**Challenge:** \
Bearcat Finance app users face challenges in managing personal finances due to a lack of a comprehensive and user-friendly financial management tool.

Bearcat Finance app users currently face significant challenges in managing their personal finances due to the lack of a comprehensive and user-friendly financial management tool. Many users are required to rely on multiple, disconnected systems to track their spending, savings, investments, and debts. This fragmented approach makes it difficult for users to obtain a clear, consolidated view of their financial health, leading to confusion and inefficiency. \
The current process is time-consuming and prone to errors. Users often have to manually input financial data into various platforms or maintain spreadsheets, which can be tedious and overwhelming. This manual tracking increases the risk of mistakes, such as missing payments, overlooking important financial commitments, or miscalculating monthly budgets. Without an integrated system, users struggle to identify patterns in their spending or pinpoint areas where they could optimize their finances. \
Additionally, users may not receive timely notifications or reminders regarding bills, deadlines, or investment opportunities, which can further compound the problem. The lack of automated features that provide real-time updates and insights leaves users feeling disconnected from their finances. This disjointed experience makes it challenging for individuals to make informed decisions about their financial future, leading to poor money management and, potentially, long-term financial instability. \
Overall, the Bearcat Finance appâ€™s existing approach forces users to expend considerable effort without offering them the tools they need to effectively manage their personal finances, resulting in frustration and inefficient financial management.
