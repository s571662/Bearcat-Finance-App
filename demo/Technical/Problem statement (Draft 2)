## Problem statement Draft 2

Bearcat Finance app users currently face significant obstacles in managing their personal finances due to the disjointed and manual nature of their existing approach. Without a unified tool, users are forced to juggle multiple, separate platforms to monitor spending, savings, investments, and debt. This fragmented process creates confusion, as users struggle to gain a complete view of their financial health, making it difficult to track progress and manage their finances effectively.

This approach is both time-consuming and error-prone. Users often rely on manual data entry across various systems or spreadsheets, which can be tedious and overwhelming. This increases the likelihood of mistakes, such as missed payments, overlooked obligations, or inaccurate budgeting. The lack of a centralized system also prevents users from easily spotting spending patterns or identifying areas where they could improve their financial management.

Additionally, users do not receive timely alerts or reminders for important deadlines, such as bill payments or investment opportunities. The absence of automated updates leaves users feeling disconnected from their finances, adding to the complexity of staying organized and making informed decisions.

Overall, the current Bearcat Finance app setup places a considerable burden on users, requiring substantial effort to manage their finances while failing to provide the necessary tools for effective, streamlined financial oversight. This disjointed experience leads to user frustration, inefficiencies, and potential long-term financial instability.
