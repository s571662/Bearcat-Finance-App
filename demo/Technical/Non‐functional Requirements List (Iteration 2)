##  Non‐functional Requirements List Iteration 2

## 1. **Performance**
   - **Expense Tracking & Budgeting:** The app should process and display updated expenses and budget data within **1 second** after user input. Categorization and updates should be reflected in real-time.
   - **Dashboard Load Time:** The financial summary dashboard must load within **2 seconds**, even when displaying multiple charts and complex reports.
   - **API Response Time:** Bank API responses for transaction imports must complete within **2 seconds**, with a retry mechanism in place for network failures.
   - **Real-Time Synchronization:** Updates made on one device should be reflected across all user devices within **1 second**, ensuring seamless real-time data synchronization.

## 2. **Scalability**
   - **User Growth:** The app should handle a growing user base without performance loss, accommodating up to **50,000 concurrent users** at peak usage times.
   - **Transaction Volume:** The system must support the handling of millions of transactions and budget records, scaling horizontally by adding additional servers or cloud resources when needed.

## 3. **Security**
   - **Encryption:** All financial data must be encrypted using **AES-256** at rest and **TLS 1.3** for data in transit. This ensures that sensitive information such as bank account details and transactions are secure.
   - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Users must authenticate with **MFA** to log in, ensuring secure account access through password and secondary authentication (e.g., SMS, email, or app-based codes).
   - **Data Protection:** User credentials and bank transaction details should be stored securely in compliance with data protection laws like **GDPR**.
   - **Security Auditing:** The system should log security events (e.g., failed login attempts) and notify users of suspicious activity immediately.

## 4. **Availability**
   - **High Uptime:** The app should guarantee **99.99% uptime**, ensuring that users can access their financial data at any time without interruption, especially for real-time transaction fetching.
   - **Redundancy & Failover:** The system should use a **redundant architecture** with automatic failover to ensure continuous availability in case of server failures.
   - **Backups:** Data should be backed up every **6 hours**, with a recovery point objective (RPO) of **5 minutes** and recovery time objective (RTO) of **10 minutes** in the event of data loss.

## 5. **Stability**
   - **Data Consistency:** Expense tracking, budgeting, and savings goals should maintain **100% consistency** across all user devices, even in case of network interruptions.
   - **Error Recovery:** In case of transaction import or synchronization errors, the system should retry the operation **3 times** before notifying the user of any failure.

## 6. **Maintainability**
   - **Modular Design:** The app’s codebase should be structured in a modular fashion, allowing individual components (e.g., expense tracking, reports, dashboard) to be updated independently without affecting the whole system.
   - **Logging and Debugging:** Detailed logs must be maintained for all financial operations, with **automated error detection** to identify and fix issues quickly.

## 7. **Usability**
   - **User Interface (UI):** The UI should be simple and intuitive, with **interactive charts** for visualizing expense categories and budgets, helping users make informed financial decisions.
   - **Error Handling:** Clear and user-friendly error messages should be displayed when users encounter issues, such as bank connection failures or budget entry errors.
   - **Accessibility:** The app must follow **WCAG 2.1 guidelines**, ensuring it is accessible to users with disabilities, including screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation.

## 8. **Portability**
   - **Cross-Platform Functionality:** The app should provide a consistent user experience across iOS, Android, and web browsers. Features like expense tracking and real-time synchronization must work seamlessly across all platforms.
   - **Data Format:** Financial data should be stored in a format (e.g., **JSON**) that allows for easy migration between platforms or integration with third-party financial tools.

## 9. **Compliance**
   - **Financial Regulations:** The app must comply with relevant financial data regulations such as **GDPR** and **PCI DSS** (if dealing with credit card transactions).
   - **Banking Standards:** All bank API integrations must adhere to **Open Banking** standards and **OAuth 2.0** for secure authentication and authorization of financial data.

## 10. **Extensibility**
   - **Future Additions:** The app architecture should allow for future integrations, such as additional bank APIs or new financial tools, without requiring major changes to the core system.
   - **Third-Party Integrations:** The system should be designed to accommodate potential integrations with financial services (e.g., tax tools, investment platforms) to enhance user experience.
